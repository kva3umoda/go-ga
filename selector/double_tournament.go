//    to discriminate good solutions. This kind of tournament is obviously
//    useless with fixed-length representation, but has been shown to
//    significantly reduce excessive growth of individuals, especially in GP,
//    where it can be used as a bloat control technique (see
//    [Luke2002fighting]_). This selection operator implements the double
//    tournament technique presented in this paper.
//
//    The core principle is to use a normal tournament selection, but using a
//    special sample function to select aspirants, which is another tournament
//    based on the size of the individuals. To ensure that the selection
//    pressure is not too high, the size of the size tournament (the number
//    of candidates evaluated) can be a real number between 1 and 2. In this
//    case, the smaller individual among two will be selected with a probability
//    *size_tourn_size*/2. For instance, if *size_tourn_size* is set to 1.4,
//    then the smaller individual will have a 0.7 probability to be selected.
//
//    .. note::
//        In GP, it has been shown that this operator produces better results
//        when it is combined with some kind of a depth limit.
